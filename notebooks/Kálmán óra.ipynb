    "# About this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was written for the [2016 Construction grammar course](http://budling.hu/elmnyelv/index.php/Constructions2016) at the [Department of Theoretical Linguistics](http://www.nytud.hu/tlp/index.html). Its main aim is to provide easier access to the [Tádé korpusz](http://hlt.bme.hu/hu/resources/tade), on which most of the experiments in the course are based.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the file shows how to download the corpus to your computer and then how to load it into a [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) *dataframe* (i.e. table). The best way to set up your own experiments is to copy this file, rename it something else (e.g. *my_fruitful_experiments**.ipynb***), and load that notebook: in this way, you won't have to worry about all this boilerplate, and you will be able to start crunching at those verb frame frequencies right away!"
